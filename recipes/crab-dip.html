    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is THE best hot crab dip. I'm going to show you how to make what I consider the king of the hot dips, which begins, like most baked dips, with cream cheese, but the key ingredients I use really amplify that crabby flavor. Use the best lump crab you can find—but whether your budget has room for the finest fresh crab or just allows for canned crab, this easy baked dip will still be a hit at your party.

</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
